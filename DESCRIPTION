Title:  Tools for working with Excel XML documents
Description:  This is a collection of some general
  and quite simple facilities for working with Excel spreadsheets and 
  workbooks. The ideas and some of the code should generalize to 
  OpenOffice and other spreadsheets. 
  At present this is intended as a relatively shallow implementation,
  and is aimed at providing a foundation to illustrate how one uses
  the XML and other packages to work with these types of documents.
  The hope is for others to contribute additional functionality or
  even take ownership of the package and extend it.
  We have developed functionality similar to this for Word and Excel
  using DCOM and the RDCOMClient facilities.
Imports: XML, Rcompression, methods
XDepends: methods
